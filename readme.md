So this is my project ultimate flipper dev board that combines an nrf box, gps neo module, wifi module CC1101 and storage module
into a sinlge module while exending wifi ranfe of flipper to beyond 100m, this is really chepwr compared to the commercially available boards buidl t 1/3 of the cost for the full 
board often the available boards do 1 or 2 things lie there are diff modules the nrf module does the nrf task . wifi module does wifi gps gps and cc101 radio
nthis should combine it all into a single board

what my board does compared to othrs, wifi pentesting from about 100m+ most modules allow 25 m range, nrf capabalitis and ble testing from 100 m, ushge of gps related functions from flipper, cc1101 will allow mw to opeart rf applications from far away.

im also designing the case for this but therer a problem likr i cant do that until i can physically because adding 3d models of external modules on pcb then designing a case around
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ab8e0f-2523-4536-9d52-09d4b3ca5031) the caSENWIll need changes depending on part availibility

view the 3d model here-

biggest problem is getting parts many like cc1101 arent avaioable at vendors accepting hcb si this cam mess the budget


budget is 50$ compeletely , samere board from rabbit labs costs 200$ so its good
didnt go from compelete pcb as it increases cost to that much and then ill have same amount of customs
