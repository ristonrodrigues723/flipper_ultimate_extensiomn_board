day 1:
may 23

so i just finished my reserch and yes creating dev boaf that lets me do everything that different flipper extension boards do combined into one is possible, and it can be created at fraction of the boards being sold online, saw some compelete diy boards , created my own wifi devboard a month ago and now think its possible to go for the ultimate dev board im plnning to make it available on hack market.

so aftr a week or reserching found out that the cmponents needed cn be bought in india just not sure of id the vendoe will allow hcb, india secific problem
seed studio still ships cheap pcb to india so its good thst i can get the pcb made (already done 5-6 pcb in diff hackclub programs).

created the bom , serched for parts and vendors and the total comes out to be under 40$ so its good

time speat today: 4 hrs (serched for a dozen vendors for prt availability locally , went through already available tutorials from talking sasquash, and others, cretaed the bom)
